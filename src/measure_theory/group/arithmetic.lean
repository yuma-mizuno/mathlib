# Typeclasses for measurability of operations

In this file we define classes `has_measurable_mul` etc and prove dot-style lemmas
(`measurable.mul`, `ae_measurable.mul` etc). For binary operations we define two typeclasses:

- `has_measurable_mul` says that both left and right multiplication are measurable;
- `has_measurable_mul₂` says that `λ p : α × α, p.1 * p.2` is measurable,

and similarly for other binary operations. The reason for introducing these classes is that in case
of topological space `α` equipped with the Borel `σ`-algebra, instances for `has_measurable_mul₂`
etc require `α` to have a second countable topology.

We define separate classes for `has_measurable_div`/`has_measurable_sub`
because on some types (e.g., `ℕ`, `ℝ≥0∞`) division and/or subtraction are not defined as `a * b⁻¹` /
`a + (-b)`.

For instances relating, e.g., `has_continuous_mul` to `has_measurable_mul` see file
`measure_theory.borel_space`.

## Implementation notes

For the heuristics of `@[to_additive]` it is important that the type with a multiplication
(or another multiplicative operations) is the first (implicit) argument of all declarations.

## Tags

measurable function, arithmetic operator

## Todo

* Uniformize the treatment of `pow` and `smul`.
* Use `@[to_additive]` to send `has_measurable_pow` to `has_measurable_smul₂`.
* This might require changing the definition (swapping the arguments in the function that is
  in the conclusion of `measurable_smul`.)
